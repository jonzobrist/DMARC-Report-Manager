# DMARC Report Manager API Documentation

The DMARC Report Manager provides a FastAPI-based backend for processing, storing, and visualizing DMARC reports.

## Base URL
The backend usually runs on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication via a **JWT (JSON Web Token)**. 

1. **Obtain a token**: Send a `POST` request to `/api/login`.
2. **Use the token**: Include it in the `Authorization` header of your requests:
   ```http
   Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Public access is limited. `GET /api/stats` can be called without a token but will hide sensitive domain names; all file, report, and domain endpoints require authentication.
